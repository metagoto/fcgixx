C++ FastCGI Protocol Driver
===========================

Synopsis
---------

 The FastCGI Protocol Driver is a C++ class library that manages all
 communication between a web server and a FastCGI user application. The
 code is highly portable and should compile fine with any moderately
 modern ISO C++ compiler.

Example Programs
----------------

Compilation
'''''''''''

 Check the settings in "Makefile", adapt them to your system, and run
 "make". The result will be two examples program that are going to be
 called ``test.fcgi'' and ``echo.fcgi``.

Installation with Apache 1.3.34, mod_fastcgi 2.4.2
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 Install the ``test.fcgi`` and ``echo.fcgi`` programs to
 ``<ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/``. Then modify ``httpd.conf`` to load
 mod_fastcgi::

  LoadModule fastcgi_module libexec/mod_fastcgi.so
  AddModule mod_fastcgi.c

 Enable access to FastCGI in Apache::

  Alias /fcgi-bin/ "/usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/"

  <Directory "/usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/>
    SetHandler fastcgi-script
  </Directory>

  FastCGIServer fcgi-bin/test.fcgi

 Go to http://localhost/fcgi-bin/test.fcgi and watch Apache's access
 log. If nothing shows up there, try the error log.

Install with lighttpd 1.4.16
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 Install the ``test.fcgi`` and ``echo.fcgi`` programs to
 ``<ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/``. Then modify ``lighttpd.conf`` to spawn the
 processes on demand::

  fastcgi.server = ( "test.fcgi" =>
    ( "localhost" =>
      ( "socket" => "/var/run/lighttpd-test-fastcgi.socket"
      , "bin-path" => "<ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/test.fcgi"
      , "check-local" => "disable"
      , "min-procs" => 1
      , "max-procs" => 3
      )
    ),
    "echo.fcgi" =>
    ( "localhost" =>
      ( "socket" => "/var/run/lighttpd-echo-fastcgi.socket"
      , "bin-path" => "<ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/echo.fcgi"
      , "check-local" => "disable"
      , "min-procs" => 1
      , "max-procs" => 3
      )
    )
  )

 Go to http://localhost/test.fcgi and watch lighttpd's access log. If
 nothing shows up there, try the error log.
